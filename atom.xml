An <code>async</code> node creates a newsource node. When an <code>async</code> node produces a value, it istreated like an event from the external environment associated from thatnew source node.</li><li><code>async</code> effectively divides the synchronous graph into aprimary subgraph and multiple secondary subgraphs, maintaining eventorder within each subgraph but not globally, enhancing responsivenesswithout strict global event ordering.</li></ul><h1 id="building-guis-with-elm">Building GUIs with Elm</h1><ul><li>Elm encourages separation between reactive code and GUI layout code,using a purely functional and declarative approach for graphicallayout.</li><li>Elm supports various base values, including strings, numbers, time,tuples, and graphical values like Elements and Forms.</li><li>Libraries in Elm offer data structures like options, lists, sets,and dictionaries.</li><li>Elm provides input support from devices like mouse, keyboard, touch,and also handles window attributes and network communication viaHTTP.</li><li>It supports JSON, Markdown for text creation, let-polymorphism,recursive simple types, type inference, extensible records, and a modulesystem.</li><li>Elm has two major graphical primitives: elements and forms.<ul><li>Elements are rectangles that can contain text, images, orvideos.</li><li>Forms allow for non-rectangular shapes and text, including arbitrary2D shapes with texture and color enhancements.</li></ul></li><li>Reactive GUIs in Elm interact with user input and environmentalevents using primitive signals.</li><li>Elm's signal identifiers include Mouse.position, Mouse.clicks,Window.dimensions, Time.every, Time.fps, Touch.touches, Touch.taps,Keyboard.keysDown, Keyboard.arrows, and Keyboard.shift.</li><li>Input components like text boxes, buttons, and sliders arerepresented as pairs of signals: an element for the graphical componentand a value for the input.</li><li>The <code>Input.text</code> function in Elm allows for the creationof text input components, returning a pair of signals for the graphicalinput field and the current user input.</li></ul><h1 id="other-links">Other Links</h1><ul><li><ahref="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/automaton/latest/Automaton">Understandingthe Automaton</a></li><li>Time-Travel Debugging (when Elm was still based on FRP)<ul><li><ahref="https://web.archive.org/web/20160206080252/http://elm-lang.org/blog/interactive-programming">InteractiveProgramming</a></li><li><ahref="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503091931/http://debug.elm-lang.org/">Elm’sTime Traveling Debugger</a></li><li>https://web.archive.org/web/20160504183927/http://elm-lang.org/</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK0vph1zR8s">Bret Victorstyle reactive debugging ‒ Laszlo Pandy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII">Bret Victor -Inventing on Principle</a></li></ul></li><li><ahref="https://www.youtube.com/live/vHI7XlgmYCg?si=wWyHsFa6P6FHOZbw&amp;t=2324">Reasonfor a farewell to FRP: learning curve as Elm went mainstream</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Note: This is a Paper Reading for Philip Guo's famous book "The Ph.D.Grind: A Ph.D. Student Memoir."</p><hr /><h1 id="main-strategies">Main Strategies</h1><ul><li>Be careful when choosing advisors and collaborators.</li><li>Consider the background and incentives of the advisors andcollaborators, as evidenced by recent papers, grant applications, andfuture aspirations.</li><li>Think about what you want to do, what that work is like, and howthat aligns with mutual interests.</li><li>A match in research philosophy does not imply feeling comfortableworking together.</li><li>Be extremely careful working with people with a grind mindset.</li></ul><blockquote><p>I found a master's thesis advisor, and like any ambitious student, Ibegan proposing my own partially developed research project ideas tohim. <strong>My advisor patiently entertained my ideas but ultimatelyconvinced me to focus on more conventional research topics that alignedwith both his academic interests and, more importantly, the conditionsof his grant funding. Since my master's program tuition was partiallycovered by a research grant my advisor had obtained from the U.S.government, I was obligated to work on projects within the scope of thatgrant.</strong> Therefore, I followed his recommendations and dedicatedtwo and a half years to developing prototype tools for analyzing theruntime behavior of computer programs written in the C and C++languages.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When I arrived on campus, Dawson was a recently-tenured professor whohad been at Stanford for the past eight years; professors usually earntenure (a lifetime employment guarantee) if they have published enoughnotable papers in their first seven years on the job. Dawson's mainresearch interest was in building innovative tools that couldautomatically find bugs (errors in software code) in complex pieces ofreal-world software. Over the past decade, Dawson and his students builtseveral tools that were able to find far more bugs than any of theircompetitors. Their research techniques were so effective that theycreated a successful startup company to sell software bug-findingservices based on those techniques. <strong>Although I somewhat likedDawson's projects, what appealed more to me was that his researchphilosophy matched my own: He was an ardent pragmatist who cared moreabout achieving compelling results than demonstrating theoretical"interestingness" for the sake of appearing scholarly.</strong></p><p>During my first meeting with Dawson, he seemed <strong>vaguelyinterested</strong> in my broader goals of making computer usage andprogramming more productive. <strong>However, he made it very clear thathe wanted to recruit new students to work on an automatic bug-findingtool called Klee that his grant money was currently funding.</strong>(The tool has had several names, but I will call it "Klee" forsimplicity.) From talking with other professors and senior Ph.D.students in my department, I realized it was the norm for new studentsto join an existing grant-funded research project rather than to trycreating their own original project right away. I convinced myself thatautomatically finding software bugs was an indirect way to makeprogrammers more productive, so I decided to join the Klee project.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Even though none of my particular ideas managed to persuade Scott, hewas still interested in collaborating with me to develop a projectaligned with my broader interests. <strong>During that period, Scottheld the position of an assistant professor, aiming to secure tenure atStanford, and had been there for just three years. Consequently, he waseager to publish more papers as part of his tenure quest.</strong> As Iwas funded by a fellowship, Scott didn't need to allocate funds from hisgrants to support me, which made the collaboration appealing to himwithout any significant downsides.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In hindsight, I can now see why this project was likely to facechallenges due to <strong>misaligned incentives</strong>, but at thetime, I lacked the wisdom to anticipate such issues. I had decided tobecome a Klee assistant for Cristi and Dawson because I wanted to joinan experienced older Ph.D. student and a professor who had a trackrecord of publishing papers in their specific subfield. This approachhad worked exceptionally well the previous year when I collaborated withJoel, an older Ph.D. student, and Scott, a professor, on their HCIproject, which resulted in a top-tier, award-nominated paper.</p><p>So, what was different in this case? <strong>In short, neither Cristinor Dawson had a strong urge to publish. They had already authoredseveral Klee papers together, and a cross-checking paper co-authoredwith me would have been a "nice-to-have" but not an obligatory follow-uppublication. Cristi was in the final year of his Ph.D. and didn'trequire further papers to graduate, while Dawson had already securedtenure and wasn't in a hurry to publish more. In contrast, Joel was amid-stage Ph.D. student eager to publish the first paper of hisdissertation, and Scott was an assistant professor who needed to publishprolifically to earn tenure.</strong> These two contrasting experiencestaught me the crucial importance of thoroughly understanding themotivations and incentives of potential collaborators before embarkingon a project with them.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I believe that Dawson expected Peter and me to achievepublishable results at a faster pace, which may have led him to perceiveus as either incompetent or not fully committed to our work. It's aharsh reality that, as a professor at a top-tier university, Dawson'sstudents are likely less accomplished than he was during his own Ph.D.years.</strong> The explanation is quite straightforward: Only about 1out of every 75 Ph.D. students from a top-tier university typicallypossesses the qualities necessary to become a professor at aninstitution like Stanford (or perhaps 1 out of every 200 Ph.D. studentsfrom an average university). Predictably, neither Peter nor I met thoseexceptional standards. If Dawson had partnered with a younger version ofhimself, progress may have been different.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Two years after Peter and I departed from the Klee project, Dawsoneventually found a new Ph.D. student who could successfully bring hisKlee-UC vision to fruition. In 2011, Dawson and his new studentpublished a significant paper that incorporated both Klee-UC andcross-checking ideas. Ultimately, it took three attempts involving fourdifferent Ph.D. students over five years before Dawson's originalKlee-UC concept materialized into a published paper. Of those fourstudents, only one persevered— I left the Klee project, and two othersdecided to exit the Ph.D. program altogether. From an individualstudent's standpoint, the chances of success appeared rather low.</p><p>From a professor's perspective, however, Klee-UC represented aresounding success. Since Dawson held tenure, his job was never at risk.<strong>In fact, one of the purposes of tenure is to enable professorsto take risks by pursuing more ambitious project ideas. However, thedownside of this privilege is that professors often assign students towork on these risky projects, which may have lower success rates.Students often find it challenging to decline such assignments,especially if they are financially supported by their advisors'grants.</strong> Fortunately, as I was funded by fellowships, it wasconsiderably easier for me to discontinue my involvement in the Kleeproject.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Tom's extensive experience in publishing and reviewingnumerous empirical software measurement papers made him an invaluable"insider" who understood what types of results and paper writing werewell-received by reviewers in that specific subfield. When it came timeto submit our paper at the end of that summer, Tom skillfully positionedour contributions within the context of related work, presentedcompelling arguments for the novelty and significance of our findings,and meticulously polished our paper.</strong> Three months later, I wasthrilled to receive the news that our paper, which focused on studyingthe causes of bug fixes, had been accepted at a top-tier conference.This was particularly impressive given that only 14 percent of allpapers submitted that year were accepted.</p><p>However, Tom's dedication didn't stop there. <strong>As a newly-hiredresearcher at MSR, he was motivated to build his reputation bypublishing additional papers. In the following years, we leveraged theresults from my summer 2009 internship to write two more top-tierconference papers.</strong> One of these papers explored bug reportreassignments, while the other delved into bug report reopenings andeven earned a Best Paper Award.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>During my first month in the new phase of my academic journey, Iprimarily spent my time reconnecting with old college friends, as myalma mater, MIT, was conveniently located near Harvard. Additionally, Ihad several meetings with Margo to explore potential research ideas.Margo was open to the idea of me pursuing my own project under her loosesupervision, granting me a considerable degree of intellectual freedom.<strong>However, I approached my brainstorming process pragmaticallybecause I aimed to generate a project that would genuinely excite herand secure her strong support for its inclusion in my dissertation. Toachieve this, I delved into her recent papers and grant applications togain insight into her research philosophy.</strong> I tailored my ideasto align with her preferences, recognizing the importance of harmonizingwith the subjective inclinations of senior collaborators, as well as theexpectations of paper reviewers, even within fields that are consideredtechnically objective.</p><p>At that time, reading a grant proposal was an entirely novelexperience for me, and it appeared foreign and unfamiliar. However, withtime and practice, I have since become accustomed to writing grants, andit has become a routine part of my academic life.</p></blockquote><hr /><ul><li>Apply to fellowships before starting the Ph.D. for better academicfreedom and advisor-advisee relationship.</li></ul><blockquote><p>I was also fortunate to receive two prestigious fellowships,<strong>the NSF and NDSEG graduate research fellowships</strong>. Thesefellowships were granted to only about five percent of all applicants.<strong>They covered the full expenses for five out of the six years ofmy Ph.D. studies and relieved me from the obligations of working onspecific grant-funded projects. This was a significant advantage overstudents who had to work on such projects throughout their collegeyears.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Applying to Ph.D. programs and fellowships during my master'syear</strong> gave me a huge advantage over students who applied duringsenior year of college, since I had an extra year of researchexperience.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In other fields, such as the humanities and social sciences, studentstypically do not receive direct funding from their advisors.<strong>This distinction significantly changes the dynamics of theadvisor-advisee relationship, turning the Ph.D. experience into more ofa solitary journey and less of an employer-employeearrangement.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>However, I soon came to the realization that I wasn't obligated toremain tethered to Klee in any way, given that my funding came from theNDSEG fellowship rather than Dawson's grants. In contrast, all ofDawson's other students had no option but to persist with their work onKlee, as they were supported by his Klee-related grants. Therefore, Iretained Dawson as my advisor but departed from the Klee project,embarking on the journey to create my own research project entirely fromscratch.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>From a professor's perspective, however, Klee-UC represented aresounding success. Since Dawson held tenure, his job was never at risk.<strong>In fact, one of the purposes of tenure is to enable professorsto take risks by pursuing more ambitious project ideas. However, thedownside of this privilege is that professors often assign students towork on these risky projects, which may have lower success rates.Students often find it challenging to decline such assignments,especially if they are financially supported by their advisors'grants.</strong> Fortunately, as I was funded by fellowships, it wasconsiderably easier for me to discontinue my involvement in the Kleeproject.</p></blockquote><hr /><ul><li>Question each step in the decision-making process.</li><li>Have an outline or draft of the research paper, especially theevaluation section, before starting a research project.</li><li>This brings the obvious benefit of making researchcontributions.</li><li>It also forces everyone not to push you around, helping you to jumpout of the "pecking order" slowly and surely.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Dawson believed that Klee could uncover new bugs that no automatedtool or human being had previously discovered within the code ofthousands of Linux device drivers. <strong>I recall thinking that whilefinding new Linux device driver bugs could be interesting to present ina paper, it wasn't entirely clear to me how these results constituted asubstantial research contribution.</strong> To my understanding, my rolewas to use Klee to uncover new bugs, essentially applying existingresearch, rather than significantly enhancing Klee in an innovativemanner. <strong>Moreover, I couldn't envision how my project wouldseamlessly integrate with the projects of the other five students for acoherent paper submission in March.</strong> Nevertheless, I had faithin Dawson's high-level paper writing strategy. <strong>Since I hadrecently joined the project, I didn't want to immediately question thesedecisions typically made by professors. I was assigned a specific task,and I was determined to carry it out to the best of myabilities.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>My rational understanding acknowledged that experimental research inscience and engineering fields often demands an extensive amount ofunglamorous and labor-intensive work to produce tangible results. Ph.D.students, particularly those in their first and second years, aretypically the ones tasked with undertaking the most tedious tasks—thisis essentially what we are compensated for. In a typical research group,the professor and senior Ph.D. students formulate the high-level projectplans and then delegate the responsibility of making all the intricatedetails function in practice to the junior students. First- andsecond-year students usually have minimal influence on the overalldirection of the group's project. <strong>Although I fully embraced myposition as the lowest-ranking member of the team, my emotional statestill suffered significantly during those initial months because thework was exceptionally challenging and lacked immediaterewards.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I met with Dawson to express my frustration regarding theoverwhelming task I was currently tackling. It felt ludicrous to spendseveral days configuring Klee for each new device driver. Not only wasit physically exhausting, but it also didn't seem like genuine research.What could we possibly write in our paper? That I had devoted nearly1,000 hours to manual labor in getting Klee to function with devicedrivers without gaining any meaningful insights? It didn't feel like avaluable research contribution; it seemed rather futile<strong>Additionally, panic set in as there were only five weeks leftuntil the paper submission deadline, and Dawson had yet to discuss ourgroup's paper writing strategy.</strong> Typically, writing arespectable paper submission takes a minimum of four weeks, especiallywhen coordinating efforts among six students involved in theproject.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>However, a significant problem arose. <strong>When we finallyachieved those favorable results, there were only three days left untilthe paper submission deadline, and not a single word of the paper hadbeen written yet.</strong> In such a short timeframe, it was physicallyimpossible to write, edit, and refine a paper submission that had anychance of being accepted at a top-tier computer science conference.Nevertheless, we decided to give it our best shot.</p><p>During the final 72 hours leading up to the deadline, Dawson and fiveof us students (one had dropped out of the project by this point)practically lived in the office, pulling two consecutive all-nighters towrap up the experiments and draft the paper. Deep down, all of usstudents realized that there was virtually no chance that this paperwould be accepted, but we followed Dawson's lead and pressed on.</p><p><strong>The result was a submission that can only be described as adisorganized mess – it contained numerous typos, nonsensical sentencefragments, graphics lacking explanations, and lacked concludingparagraphs.</strong> It was a dismal sight. At that moment, I couldn'tfathom how I would ever complete a Ph.D. if it meant working in such achaotic and haphazard manner. As anticipated, three months later, thereviews for our paper were overwhelmingly negative, filled with harshcomments like, "The program committee believes that this paper is fartoo sloppily prepared to warrant acceptance; please refrain fromsubmitting papers that are clearly unready for review."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>My friend Greg, who was one of Rob's Ph.D. students, emphasized thesignificance of the third point: <strong>thinking about experiments whensuggesting research project ideas</strong>. <strong>Professors are oftendriven by the desire to have their names associated with publishedpapers, and in the field of computer science, conference paperstypically require robust experiments to secure acceptance forpublication.</strong> Therefore, it's essential to consider experimentdesign right from the outset when formulating project proposals.</p></blockquote><hr /><ul><li>Target fellow researchers with similar incentives when conductingHCI studies in academia.</li><li>Without exceptionally strong resources, find a novel, meaningfulniche for research instead of an overcrowded and highly competitivedomain.</li><li>Do not attempt to do in academia what should be done inindustry.</li></ul><blockquote><p>In hindsight, I'm not astonished that my efforts to shadowprofessionals in their workplaces were unsuccessful. I had nothing tocontribute to these seasoned programmers; my presence would have likelydisrupted their workday. <strong>Fortunately, a few years later, I hadthe opportunity to observe a different group of programmers—fellowgraduate students engaged in programming for scientific research. Theywere open to my occasional inquiries and more than willing to discusstheir working environments.</strong> These interviews would ultimatelyserve as a direct source of inspiration for my dissertation work.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Dawson and I encountered significant challenges in getting ourresearch results published. Over the course of a year, we submitted twopapers that were both rejected. It would take another full year beforeour work was finally published as a shorter-length paper in asecond-tier conference, which held minimal prestige and did not count asa contribution to my dissertation. However, by that point, I had alreadymoved on to other projects.</p><p>The primary reason behind our struggles with publication was that wewere not considered "insiders" in the empirical software measurementsubfield (sometimes referred to as empirical software engineering), towhich our project belonged. When Dawson and I embarked on this work,numerous research teams from various universities and corporate researchlabs were already engaged in similar endeavors. <strong>We were clearlyoutmatched by the competition, which included professors and researchscientists specializing in empirical software measurement, guidingarmies of Ph.D. students through the extensive data analysis. Theseindividuals were eager to publish a multitude of papers, especiallyyoung professors aspiring to attain tenure. They possessed expertise instatistical methodologies, framing related work, and crafting persuasivenarratives needed to secure acceptance for such papers. Mostsignificantly, they frequently served on program committees and acted asexternal reviewers for relevant conferences, which provided them within-depth knowledge of the requisites for producing publishable papers inthis subfield.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>One significant advantage of being an intern at MSR was access to awealth of internal data sets containing information about Microsoft'ssoftware bugs and personnel files. These confidential data sets wouldhave been inaccessible to me as an external researcher. <strong>Therichness of these Microsoft data sets provided MSR researchers like Tomwith a distinct advantage, making it easier to obtain groundbreaking andpublishable results compared to competitors who lacked access to suchdata.</strong></p><p>In contrast, when I worked with Dawson, the Linux data sets I hadaccess to were smaller and of lower quality. Open-source softwareprojects typically do not maintain records as meticulously as one of theworld's largest software companies. <strong>This limitation is somethingthat all university researchers face unless they establish partnershipswith companies that can provide them with access to relevantdata.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Upon returning to Stanford in the fall of 2009, inspired by myprevious HCI work with Scott and Joel during my second year, I embarkedon a project to interview colleagues who used Python for data analysisin their research. <strong>The objective was to identify theprogramming-related inefficiencies they faced and explore how IncPycould address and eliminate these inefficiencies.</strong> I alsoleveraged my connections to give presentations about IncPy, even thoughit was still a half-baked idea at that stage, at various lab groupmeetings. These early efforts helped generate fresh ideas and refine theproject's "marketing pitch." I'm deeply thankful for the friends whosupported me in kickstarting my project when I had little more than afew rudimentary PowerPoint slides.</p><p>As I continued my interviews and refined my design plans, I grewincreasingly optimistic. I discovered that researchers in variouscomputation-based fields, including machine learning, pharmacology,bioengineering, bioinformatics, neuroscience, and ocean engineering, allfaced similar challenges in their data analysis workflows, making thempotential beneficiaries of IncPy. <strong>After a few weeks ofinterviews and subsequent adjustments to my project's direction, I feltconfident that I could convincingly pitch the idea in a future papersubmission. The core argument I aimed to convey was that manycomputational researchers across diverse fields grappled with commoninefficiencies in their daily programming tasks, and IncPy presented anovel, fully automated solution to these inefficiencies that had notbeen previously implemented. This initial pitch would ultimately becomethe central theme of my entire dissertation.</strong></p></blockquote><hr /><ul><li>Climb the shoulders of giants as much as possible and pick thelow-hanging fruit from there before you become a giant.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Following the creation of Klee and related projects between 2005 and2008, a new subfield emerged. <strong>This development led to numerousassistant professors and young research scientists eagerly producing aplethora of papers, each detailing incremental improvements in theirquest to secure tenure or job promotions.</strong> It was akin to anacademic gold rush, spurred by the early insights of Cristi, Dawson, anda select few pioneers. Since Dawson already possessed tenure and hadgained fame for his contributions, he was above the fray and lacked thedesire to publish solely for the purpose of bolstering his academicresume.</p><p><strong>In practice, Ph.D. students collaborating with these youngresearchers found it comparatively easier to publish their work andcomplete their graduate programs, while Dawson's students facedconsiderably more challenges.</strong> Over the three years since Ideparted from the Klee project, research groups worldwide havecollectively published hundreds of papers grounded in Klee-likeconcepts. Remarkably, fifteen of these papers detailed enhancements toKlee itself, as our laboratory released it as open-source software toencourage further research. <strong>In the meantime, five of Dawson'sPh.D. students have made serious efforts to work on Klee; however, onlyone has managed to publish a single paper on Klee-UC.</strong></p></blockquote><hr /><ul><li>Actively expand your network and seek collaborationopportunities.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Just before commencing my second year of the Ph.D. program inSeptember 2007, I took a one-week vacation to Boston to visit friendsfrom college. While in the area, I reached out to a few MIT professors Iknew from my undergraduate years, seeking their guidance. During ourmeetings, they all conveyed a similar message: <strong>Take theinitiative to engage with professors, explore research topics of mutualinterest, and above all, avoid isolation.</strong> This straightforwardadvice, consistently applied over the next five years, ultimately pavedthe way for a successful completion of my Ph.D. journey.</p><p>I wasted no time in taking this advice to heart while still inBoston. I sent a cold email to an MIT computer science professor namedRob, politely requesting a meeting with him. In this initial email, Ibriefly introduced myself as a recent MIT graduate and a currentStanford Ph.D. student with a keen interest in developing tools toenhance the productivity of computer programmers. Given that I knew Robshared an interest in this research area, I hoped my email would piquehis interest rather than end up in his spam folder. Fortunately, Robgenerously agreed to meet with me for an hour in his office, duringwhich I presented a few project proposals and sought his feedback. Heappeared to find merit in my ideas, which bolstered my confidence thatthey held promise in the eyes of a professor working in this researchdomain. Regrettably, I couldn't collaborate with Rob as I was no longeran MIT student. <strong>Nonetheless, at the conclusion of our meeting,Rob suggested that I approach a Stanford computer science professornamed Scott to see if I could garner his interest in myideas.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The lasting impact of an MSR (Microsoft Research) internship oftenextends beyond research achievements to the friendships forged duringthe experience. <strong>During that particular summer, I had theprivilege of forming connections with some of the brightest and mostinspiring young computer science researchers of my generation.</strong>For example, one of my three office mates was on the verge of beginningher Ph.D. journey at MIT and had already published more top-tier papersduring her undergraduate research than most Ph.D. students could everaspire to. Another office mate was a UC Berkeley Ph.D. student whodedicated his nights and weekends to a separate research project withcollaborators from across the country, all while diligently working onhis internship project during workdays. These peers are likely to evolveinto award-winning professors, research leaders, and high-techentrepreneurs, and I am genuinely humbled to have had the opportunity toshare a summer with them.</p></blockquote><hr /><ul><li>This is how we can evaluate productivity claims.</li></ul><blockquote><p>From the very beginning of my IncPy project, I recognized thechallenge of presenting a compelling evaluation. <strong>The corepremise, that IncPy could enhance the productivity of computationalresearchers, was inherently subjective. To address this, after studyingsimilar papers, I developed a two-pronged evaluationapproach</strong>:</p><p><strong>Case Studies: I planned to gather a variety of Pythonprograms from computational researchers and simulate the productivitygains they might have achieved using IncPy instead of standardPython.</strong></p><p>Deployment: The goal was to encourage researchers to incorporateIncPy into their regular work, allowing them to <strong>directlyexperience and report on its impact on their productivity</strong>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In pursuit of this, <strong>I adopted the roles of both salesman andbeggar, persistently seeking Python programs from colleagues for my casestudies and encouraging them to use IncPy in their research.</strong>Despite mostly receiving negative responses, I continued asking forreferrals and volunteered to speak at various lab meetings to generateinterest in IncPy. After months of effort, I managed to acquire Pythonprograms from researchers across various fields, sufficient for startingmy case studies.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As I concluded my fourth Ph.D. year in September 2010, I submitted myIncPy paper to a top-tier conference. The paper included <strong>casestudies and a few deployment anecdotes</strong>. Aware of the lowacceptance rate and the unconventional nature of IncPy within academicfields, I was prepared for potential rejection but still aimed high,knowing the value of a top-tier publication for my graduationprospects.</p></blockquote><hr /><ul><li>The runtime is a vital (yet often overlooked) aspect to consider inprogramming language research.</li></ul><blockquote><p>On July 29, 2010, a year after the initial concept of IncPy was born,I was struck by another idea, this time addressing a common issue incomputational research. <strong>I noticed that researchers often writetheir computer programs in an ad-hoc, somewhat careless manner, leadingto frequent crashes for trivial reasons. These crashes not only preventthe production of any results but also cause considerablefrustration.</strong></p><p><strong>My realization was that by modifying the runtime environmentof the Python programming language, specifically the interpreter, Icould address this issue.</strong> The idea was to adapt the Pythoninterpreter in a way that would allow these less rigorously writtenprograms to still run and produce partial results, rather than failingcompletely and producing none. I decided to name this modified versionof the Python interpreter "SlopPy," a playful blend of 'Sloppy' and'Python', emphasizing its tolerance for less meticulous codingpractices. This concept aimed to make the process of data analysis moreforgiving and efficient for researchers who may not always adhere tostringent coding standards.</p></blockquote><hr /><ul><li>Focus on acknowledging shortcomings and deriving their insights ifexperimental evaluation results are suboptimal.</li></ul><blockquote><p>While I was interning at Google during the summer of 2011, I receivedthe joyful news that our ProWrangler paper had been accepted withoutstanding reviews. The main factor contributing to our success wasJeff's exceptional work in crafting both the introduction of our paperand the interpretation of our evaluation results. <strong>Initially, ouruser testing had not demonstrated the productivity improvements we hadhoped for, which made me concerned that our paper might face rejection.However, Jeff's skill in technical writing and framing our argumentsskillfully transformed what seemed like impending failure into asurprising victory. The reviewers appreciated our candid acknowledgmentof the shortcomings in our evaluation and the valuable insights weextracted from them.</strong> Undoubtedly, our paper would not havegained acceptance without Jeff's rhetorical expertise. He hadaccumulated substantial experience in this area, having published 19papers during his Ph.D. studies, mostly in top-tier conferences, whichis five to ten times more than what is typically expected from computerscience Ph.D. students. This level of dedication and productivity isoften necessary to secure a faculty position at a prestigious universitylike Stanford.</p></blockquote><hr /><ul><li>In fiercely competitive domains, do not self-consciously try tonetwork and seek opportunities, and never schmooze. Instead, rely onbypasses and side roads. Many things grow in the garden that were neversown there（有心栽花花不开，无心插柳柳成荫）.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>When I made the decision to leave academia, one of theimmediate impacts was that I no longer felt the need to engage innetworking activities at the three academic conferences I attended thatsummer. These conferences included talks I gave on IncPy, SlopPy, andCDE. Academic conferences are typically filled with senior Ph.D.students, postdocs, and pre-tenure professors who are activelynetworking to impress their more senior colleagues. For these juniorresearchers, professional networking at conferences is a crucial andtime-consuming task as it greatly influences their budding careers andacademic reputations. However, since I had decided to step away from theacademic world, I found myself enjoying the conferences without theusual nervousness or strategic calculations.</strong></p><p>At one of these conferences, I had a casual conversation with John, aprofessor from the University of Utah who was the keynote speaker. Lateron, he wrote a generous blog post that significantly increased thepopularity of "The Ph.D. Grind" among professors. He also provided mewith practical advice regarding the possibility of returning to academiamyself. <strong>This unexpected turn of events occurred because I was nolonger driven by a desire to stay in academia and simply chatted withpeople I found interesting at the conference without a specificnetworking agenda.</strong> It was a reminder of how unpredictable lifecan be.</p><p>During a break between sessions at another conference, I noticedMargo sitting alone and working on her laptop. I had previously metMargo during my fourth year at a San Jose workshop where I presented myoriginal IncPy paper. Although I had some reservations about approachingher and reintroducing myself, fearing that she might not remember me orthat our conversation might lack substance, my impending departure fromacademia meant I had no real networking agenda to uphold. I decided totake the chance and greeted her. I reminded her of our previousencounter, and she appeared to recall me. We had a brief five-minuteconversation about my new CDE project before I had to rush off to givemy talk. After returning home, I sent her a courteous follow-up emailwith a link to the CDE project webpage, in case her students wereinterested in using it for their research. This was my standard politeapproach when introducing CDE to professional colleagues, and I didn'thave high expectations for follow-up.</p><p>As it turned out, Margo would later play a pivotal role in helping mesecure a professorship. <strong>Ironically, if I had initially desired aprofessorship, I might have been too self-conscious and hesitant toapproach her in the first place, which could have diminished my chancesof eventually obtaining the position. In the end, it was because Ididn't actively seek a professorship at the time that I ultimately endedup getting one.</strong> Life has its own unique way of working thingsout!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>The culmination of my graduate school journey wouldn't havebeen possible if I hadn't actively seized the opportunities that I wasfortunate enough to receive.</strong> If Robert hadn't informed me aboutthe San Jose workshop two years ago, if I hadn't submitted and presentedmy IncPy paper there, if Margo hadn't taken an interest in my paper andintroduced me to Elaine, if I hadn't maintained contact with Elaine, ifI hadn't spontaneously approached Margo again at last summer'sconference where I presented CDE, if she hadn't sent me a graciousfollow-up email, and if I hadn't taken a risk with my unconventionalcounterproposal to her, then <strong>I would have still been at Stanfordstruggling to find one last project and thesis committeemember</strong>.</p><p><strong>It's important to acknowledge that achieving this outcomerequired me to try many different approaches like this, and most of themdid not yield the desired results.</strong> Success often involvesnumerous attempts and failures before finding the right path.</p></blockquote><h1 id="supportive-tactics">Supportive Tactics</h1><ul><li>Optimize the process of note-taking for research.</li></ul><blockquote><p>My daily routine primarily revolved around the development ofcomputer programs designed to extract, clean, reformat, and analyze datafrom the Linux revision control history and the 2,000 bug reports.<strong>In my pursuit of gaining insights, I independently acquired afoundational understanding of quantitative data analysis, statistics,and data visualization techniques. Throughout my work, I meticulouslyrecorded my experimental progress in a research lab notebook, carefullydocumenting which trials were successful and which werenot.</strong></p><p>Every week or so, I would meet with Dawson to present my findings.<strong>Typically, these meetings involved me presenting him withprintouts of graphs or data tables generated through my analyses,followed by him offering high-level suggestions, such as, "This part ofthe graph appears unusual; can you explain why? Try breaking down thedata in this manner and delve deeper."</strong> It was only years laterthat I discovered this working style was relatively common amongcomputational researchers in various academic disciplines. For mydissertation, I went on to develop tools aimed at streamlining thetypical inefficiencies in this prevalent workflow. However, at thattime, I had no such long-term vision; my primary goal was to makeintriguing discoveries and have them published.</p></blockquote><hr /><ul><li>Raise encountered problems and frustrations, no matter how minor, atmeetings and complain.</li><li>Actively contact people for feedback, motivation, and emotionalsupport.</li></ul><blockquote><p>I found myself navigating unfamiliar territory, making itsignificantly more challenging to seek assistance compared to myundergraduate years when solutions were more straightforward. As thesole person working with Klee on device driver code, my colleaguescouldn't offer much guidance. <strong>While Dawson occasionally providedhigh-level strategic advice, as is customary for tenured professors, hisrole didn't involve being directly involved in the day-to-day challengeswe faced. It fell upon us, the students, to decipher all the intricatedetails necessary to yield results—my task being to uncover new bugs inLinux device drivers that had not been previously identified. Professorsoften reiterate the mantra, "If it's already been done before, then itwouldn't be research!"</strong> For the first time, I truly grasped theessence of those words.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>For the following ten weeks, I found myself daydreaming about my ownresearch concepts in complete isolation, without engaging in anyconversations with others. Given my negative initial experience workingin a research group over the past few months, I craved solitude to thinkindependently. Dawson was supportive of my absence since he wasn'tfinancially supporting me through his grants.</p><p>I lived in complete seclusion, mentally drained but still attemptingto make gradual progress. Each day, I dedicated myself to readingnumerous computer science research papers and taking notes in the hopeof finding inspiration for my own creative ideas. However, lackingproper guidance or context, I often ended up squandering a lot of timewithout gaining meaningful insights from my readings. I also roamedaimlessly on my bicycle through the neighborhoods around campus, hopingto spark new research ideas to no avail. Most notably, I procrastinatedmore than I ever had in my life up to that point: I watched countless TVshows, took numerous naps, and wasted countless hours online. Unlike myfriends with conventional nine-to-five jobs, there was no supervisormonitoring my daily activities, so I allowed my mind to wander withoutany structure in my life.</p><p>During those ten solitary weeks, I scarcely spoke to anyone, not evenmy friends or family. Complaining seemed futile because it felt likenobody could truly grasp what I was going through at the time. Myfriends who were not pursuing Ph.D. programs believed I was simply "inschool" and taking classes like a typical student. Meanwhile, the fewfriends I had made in my department were grappling with their ownfirst-year Ph.D. struggles, primarily the shock of diving headfirst intocomplex, open-ended research problems without the ability to influencethe overarching direction of their assigned projects. We, as youngcomputer scientists, willingly engaged in tasks that were bothexceptionally challenging and seemingly devoid of purpose, all whileearning a quarter of the salary of our friends in the corporate world.It was so disheartening that it became almost comically tragic.<strong>However, I didn't believe that group complaining would beproductive, so I chose to remain silent. I avoided the Computer ScienceDepartment building, fearing encounters with colleagues who mightinevitably inquire about my work, and I had no respectable response tooffer. Instead, I preferred secluding myself in libraries and coffeeshops.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In hindsight, going solo so early in my graduate school journey was aregrettable decision. Contrary to romanticized notions of a solitaryscholar sitting outdoors, sipping a latte, and scribbling on blanknotebook pages, real research is never conducted in isolation. Itnecessitates a solid foundation in intellectual, historical, andsometimes even physical aspects (such as laboratory equipment) todevelop innovative ideas. <strong>A wiser approach during those weekswould have been to communicate with Dawson more frequently and activelyseek collaborations with other professors or senior students. However,at that time, I was so burnt out and frustrated with the traditionalhierarchy of group-based research – which often involved new Ph.D.students performing the most unglamorous tasks – that I retreated andembarked on my own path.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>By the middle of my third year, many of my fellow students and Ifound ourselves in a state of "limbo." <strong>It became increasinglychallenging to muster the motivation to come into the office day in andday out. We also grappled with feelings of isolation and loneliness, aswe spent our days and nights immersed in tackling obscure, highlyspecialized problems that few people in our immediate surroundingscomprehended or showed interest in.</strong> While our advisors andsenior colleagues occasionally offered high-level guidance, they seldomsat down with us to work through the intricate details of our researchendeavors.</p></blockquote><hr /><ul><li>If there is work-life balance in a job and stress levels are not toohigh, i.e., one is not drained or overburned, would it be a viableopportunity to pursue self-improvement and open doors for futurepursuits?</li></ul><blockquote><p>Of course, it would be foolish to pursue a Ph.D. solely out ofirrational childhood fears. <strong>To get a preview of corporateworking life, I did internships at engineering companies every summerduring college. Since I happened to work in offices where I was the onlyintern, I was given the full responsibilities of a junior engineer,which was a rare privilege. Although I learned a lot of technicalskills, I found the day-to-day work to be mind-numbingly dull.</strong>My coworkers were also unenthusiastic about their jobs, and there werefew appealing prospects for career advancement. Of course, I'm notclaiming that all engineering jobs are mind-numbingly dull; it justhappened that the companies I worked for were not first-rate. Many of mycollege friends who interned at first-rate companies such as Microsofthad great experiences. Ironically, my first full-time job afterfinishing my Ph.D. was at Google. Google loved their experiences andsigned on to work at those companies full-time after graduation.</p></blockquote><hr /><ul><li>Research software tends to be rough prototypes. Keep them simple,stupid.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Similar to other sophisticated software tools, Klee featurednumerous configurable options. However, since it was a researchprototype assembled by students, most of these options lacked cleardocumentation regarding their behaviors.</strong> Consequently, I spenta significant amount of time grappling with misunderstandings about thesubtle interactions between these options as I adjusted them. Myresearch lab notebook became filled with frustrations, including entrieslike: "OH SH*T, I believe my mistake was failing to realize that thereare specific options meant to be passed into Klee (e.g.,-emit-all-errors), and others that should be passed into the targetprogram to set up the model environment (e.g., --sym-args). When theseget confused, bizarre outcomes occur because Klee ends up executing thetarget program with argc and argv values that differ from what you'dexpect."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>From a research perspective, my goal was achieved: <strong>Isuccessfully developed an initial prototype of CDE and demonstrated itsfunctionality in a practical use case. In many applied engineeringfields, it's widely accepted that research prototypes like CDE primarilyserve to prove the feasibility of innovative concepts. The role of aresearcher involves creating prototypes, conducting experimentalassessments to measure their effectiveness, publishing research papers,and then moving on to the next idea.</strong> It would be unrealisticfor a researcher to expect people to use their prototypes as if theywere fully-fledged products. <strong>Instead, if the ideas arepromising, professional engineers may incorporate them into theircompany's future products.</strong> At best, some other research groupsmight utilize your prototypes as a foundation to develop their ownprototypes and subsequently reference your work in their papers (forexample, more than a dozen university research groups have expanded uponthe Klee tool and published papers detailing their enhancements).However, it is exceedingly rare for individuals outside of the researchcommunity to employ research prototypes in their daily tasks. Inessence, the objective of academic research is to generate validatedideas, not refined products.</p></blockquote><hr /><p>Make full use of workshops to disseminate preliminary results andcollect feedback rapidly, even if it involves spending moneyyourself.</p><blockquote><p>Typically, I wouldn't have paid much attention to such anannouncement for two reasons. Firstly, Robert's research area, dataprovenance, had no direct relevance to IncPy, so his paper submissionsdidn't affect me. Secondly, in our department, workshop papers don'tusually count as substantial contributions toward a dissertation.<strong>Workshops are primarily meant for sharing early-stage ideas andtend to have much higher acceptance rates (60 to 80 percent) compared toconferences (8 to 30 percent). Many professors prefer their students tofocus on publishing in conferences since workshops require them to covertravel, hotel, and registration costs, similar to conferences, butwithout the same level of prestige.</strong> Consequently, top-tiercomputer science professors often encourage their students to prioritizeconference papers over workshop submissions.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>While presenting my IncPy workshop paper was beneficial for feedbackand networking, particularly with Margo, it didn't qualify as anofficial publication for my dissertation. I was aware that publishingthis work at a recognized conference in my department was necessary.<strong>The main difference between a workshop and a conference paperlies in the requirement for a conference paper to have a robustexperimental evaluation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposedtool or technique.</strong> The evaluation part of a paper can vary,from measuring runtime performance to conducting user behavior studiesin a controlled environment. Given the commonality of similar researchideas, reviewers pay close attention to the implementation andexperimental analysis of these ideas when deciding on the acceptance orrejection of papers.</p></blockquote><h1 id="mindset">Mindset</h1><ul><li>Find a meaning for your research and build a reputation.</li></ul><blockquote><p>After two months of persistent effort, I began to achieve some modestvictories. I managed to get Klee to function well enough to identify myfirst few bugs in the smallest device drivers. <strong>To ascertainwhether these bugs were genuine (as opposed to false positives resultingfrom Klee's limitations), I sent emails outlining each potential bug tothe Linux developers responsible for those drivers. Several drivercreators verified that I had indeed discovered real bugs in their code.These email confirmations brought me great excitement, as theyrepresented my initial glimpses of external validation.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The skill of crafting concise and impactful professional emails hasproven to be highly beneficial for my career.</p></blockquote><hr /><ul><li>Do not bootlick the "establishment" or the "mainstream." Be wise andbrave, identify emergent trends, conquer virgin land, and blazeunheard-of new paths.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>The second and more significant reason why pursuing a postdocdidn't make sense for me was the nature of the research topics I wastruly passionate about. These topics didn't align well with thelikelihood of winning grant funding because they weren't widely acceptedby the current academic establishment.</strong> Without grants, it wouldbe impossible to fund students to work on these topics, and withoutmotivated students to tackle the challenging manual work involved, itwould be difficult to produce reputable publications. Furthermore,without a substantial number of publications each year, achieving tenurewould be out of reach. Even if I did manage to secure tenure, I wouldstill require new grants to support new students in implementing myideas, perpetuating an ongoing funding cycle. Given my researchinterests, I wasn't emotionally prepared to engage in the uphill battlesnecessary to have my proposals taken seriously by grant fundingagencies. Convincing peer reviewers to accept my papers had already beena challenge, and grant reviewers would likely be even less sympathetic,as they control the distribution of significant financial resources andwould prefer to allocate funding to colleagues conducting moremainstream computer science research.</p><p><strong>When I began my faculty career in 2014, this was my greatestfear. Consequently, I deliberately transitioned to a new research areathat had greater potential for securing funding.</strong></p><p><strong>Out of the 26 Ph.D. graduates in the Stanford ComputerScience Department from my year, I considered myself relatively averagefrom an academic perspective, as most of my papers were second-tier andnot well-received by the academic community. My dissertation workstraddled multiple computer science subfields, including ProgrammingLanguages, Human-Computer Interaction, and Operating Systems, which madeit challenging to gain recognition from top experts in any one specificsubfield.</strong></p><p><strong>Given that my dissertation topic was far from mainstream, anyjunior professor or scientist attempting to build their academic careeraround its concepts would face difficulties gaining the approval ofgrant funding agencies, crucial for launching new projects, and thesupport of senior colleagues, essential for publication and tenure.While I am more than willing to support anyone willing to take on thiscommendable challenge, I wasn't courageous enough to risk my own careeron it.</strong> Instead, I have chosen to pursue an entirely differentprofessional passion, which may become the subject of a future book.</p><p><strong>Interestingly, these ideas eventually became more fundable inthe year after I graduated, thanks to the emergence of the Big Data anddata science movements. However, by that time, I had already shifted myfocus to other interests.</strong></p></blockquote>]]></content>

For instance, one user used macOS Notes to detaila process involving data transfer between Sentinel Hub, QGIS,Illustrator, and Photoshop, documenting everything from selecting aSentinel-2 image to reassembling raster segments in Illustrator.

TheSketch-n-sketch application is a testament to the successful merger ofthese methods for SVG graphics.</p><p>Such a combined approach could also remedy the fundamental issueparticipants faced when using direct manipulation tools for cartography:the need to recreate map designs in code after finishing a design.</p><hr /><h1 id="how-statically-typed-functional-programmers-write-code"><ahref="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485532">How Statically-TypedFunctional Programmers Write Code</a></h1><p>A deeper comprehension of the coding methods of statically-typedfunctional programmers could lead to the creation of more practicaltools, more user-friendly programming languages, and better gatewaysinto programming communities.</p><p>These programmers utilize their compilers for more than justproducing an executable; they also use compilers as corrective anddirective aids.</p><ul><li>Compilers as corrective tools.

This could be due to pattern matching's explicit textualrepresentation of tasks, explicit handling of recursion, or consistentinterface across various data structures. Nonetheless, some programmersprefer to rewrite their code using combinators eventually. Ideally, atool would assist in this process, starting with a data type and guidingthe programmer through case completion, subsequently offering a seriesof combinators as a refined alternative.</p><p>It is beneficial to recognize which language constructs allow forlow-workload or opportunistic construction and how these constructs arevalued within the programming community.</p><p>There's a demand for tools that minimize the difficulty of alteringtypes during development. Furthermore, these tools should facilitate thenatural cyclic changes of a developer's focus between modifying typesand modifying expressions, possibly by employing program repairtechniques to predict how changes in one will affect the other.</p><p>Program sketches provide a wealth of information about undefinedfunctions, like inferred types and potential uses. Sincestatically-typed functional programmers regularly employ this method ofdrafting and refining code, there's a clear opportunity for tools thatcould enhance or even automate parts of this practice.</p>]]></content>

Also, what do you aim to achievewith it? There seem to be several components you've touched upon, suchas visualization, pipeline development, and programming processes. Theserepresent different approaches you could potentially adopt or considerintegrating into a comprehensive pipeline. I believe the ultimate goalhere is to aid research programmers in accelerating system developmentwhile minimizing errors, correct?</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [00:43] Yes, precisely.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [00:45] Let's delve into your research focus. How doesyour current work align with this?</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [00:52] My ongoing research isn't directly related, asthis is a path I'm contemplating for a future Ph.D. project, which Istill need to commit to. I'm currently working on my master's thesistitled 'Type Inference for Python.' It aims to infer types in Pythoncode, which often lacks annotations. This lack can lead to IDEsproviding less accurate suggestions. With type information, predictionsbecome more reliable, enhancing the coding and code interactionexperience.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [01:54] So, to clarify, your project is about developinga system for automatic type inference that assists IDEs, not justcreating a type annotation database. Existing tools do offer preliminarytype extraction, but I'm interested in the novel contribution yourresearch makes.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [02:31] Exactly. I'm not just extracting types; I'minferring them in unannotated code bases to enhance IDEfunctionality.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [02:45] Understood. There are incremental typing toolsavailable, but we can explore that later. For now, it's great thatyou're well-versed in Python, especially since it's prevalent in LLMresearch. An interesting aspect of your direction could be mitigatingbugs, which often derail projects. Implementing automated checks couldbe invaluable. However, the challenge lies in determining which aspectsof research programming are amenable to systematization.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [06:17] My vision is to support researchers engaged indata analysis or custom model design in an environment akin to Jupyternotebooks. And touching on debugging, I see a potential to harnessfunctional programming due to its purity and ease of debugging.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [07:22] The question, however, is the application offunctional programming to research code, which often depends onpre-existing libraries. While functional design has its merits, thepracticality of integrating it into the current ecosystem is worthdiscussing.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [07:55] I concede the point; many codebases are indeedmessy. I'm contemplating a clean slate design, potentially developing anew language or library to demonstrate the concept.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [08:21] It's noteworthy that there have beenadvancements in code tracing, like PyTorch 2's bytecode analysis, which,while not addressing verifiability directly, allows for in-depth programbehavior analysis.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [11:09] Certainly. There are facets of current notebooktechnologies that pique my interest, primarily due to their inadequatesupport, with debugging being a prime example. Debugging encompasses twokey aspects: the logic of the program, as previously mentioned, and dataprovenance. Sometimes, despite the sound logic, I need to delve into theorigins of an unexpected output data point by tracing the implicitcalculations that led to it.</p><p>[11:58] This necessity for data provenance tracking is something Ifind critically important in my daily research, and I understand it'sknown as the data provenance problem.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [12:09] Indeed, if you've ever discussed this withMargo, you're likely well-versed in the topic, given her researchfocuses precisely on provenance. Many of her colleagues are exploringthis area, which is complex, particularly in the context of outputs fromextensive machine learning models. While it would be beneficial to tracedata points back to their origins, integrating such a mechanism into amodel is a formidable challenge.</p><p>[12:55] As a developer, I'm keen on understanding the influence ofinput data on outputs, which is central to the challenge of explainableAI (XAI). Resolving this would mark a significant milestone. However,pinpointing specific model features or layers leading to an output isperhaps more accessible and useful for debugging.</p><p>[13:53] For instance, identifying a misconfigured layer responsiblefor input-related issues would be invaluable. Although considering theinterconnected nature of model layers, this remains a complex task.</p><p>[14:57] The concept of 'radioactively' tagging data to trace itsinfluence through a model is an intriguing one, akin to tracking theuptake of a tagged substance in a biological system. Yet, translatingthis to a machine learning environment presents a unique set ofchallenges.</p><p>[16:57] While I'm not deeply familiar with the latest advancements inthis field, it's clear that XAI could significantly benefit HCIapplications. The goal is to incrementally address these challenges bydeveloping models that acknowledge tagged inputs throughout the dataprocessing pipeline.</p><p>[17:58] These are some thoughts on the subject. I'd like to knowwhich aspects you find most relevant or valuable for your futureendeavors.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [18:15] The examples and pointers you've provided areinsightful. As someone with a software engineering background, I believethat adapting certain constructs, like functional programming andtraditional program analysis, could offer potential solutions. These aredirections I'm considering for my Ph.D. research.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [18:58] Exploring program tracing for optimization couldprove fruitful, given the untapped potential in that area. Thephilosophy I subscribe to favors solutions that minimize user effort,exemplified by the tracing compiler feature in PyTorch 2.0. UnlikeTensorFlow model, which requires upfront operation declarations,PyTorch's immediate mode operation presents a more straightforwardapproach for users, facilitating a clearer understanding of variableflow during execution.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [ 24:12 ] Incidentally, as a researcher in HCI, have youever engaged in work that marries aspects of software engineering,specifically functional programming, with HCI?</p><p>Robert Xiao: [ 24:28 ] My experience with functional programming in aresearch capacity is virtually nonexistent. My computer scienceeducation covered the basics of functional programming - I dabbled inScheme and Racket - but in terms of research, functional programminghasn't been part of my repertoire. Our work typically involves Python,C#, and various visual programming tools, none of which adhere to afunctional programming paradigm.</p><p>[ 24:56 ] Game programming, which encompasses many of our VR/ARprogramming, is about as far removed from functional programming aspossible. It's heavily state-driven, with an ever-changing stateenvironment. A functional approach could be applied to VR/ARdevelopment. It could offer advantages over current methods. I'm awareof actor model programming being used for VR/AR experiences, though it'snot functional programming per se, and I have yet to adopt it in my workpersonally. Conversely, when it comes to software engineering, we dointegrate its methodologies into our software creation process. Thisincludes best practices like code structuring for reusability,modularization, refactoring, and especially source control, which I findis grossly underutilized in research programming, among otherthings.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [ 26:33 ] Understood, yes.</p><p>My vision, when I speak of integrating functional programming, isn'tconfined to conventional languages like Scheme or Racket that youmentioned earlier.</p><p>My thoughts were more aligned with programming paradigms like theactor model you described, as well as visual programming. I'm interestedin approaches that are more formalized, easier to reason about, andoffer a clearer path to verifying properties and facilitatingdebugging.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [ 27:18 ] With general-purpose imperative coding, thedebugging process is, frankly, a nightmare. Although my personalexperience in developing large-scale games is limited, our researchtypically involves creating specific VR/AR experiences. These aresmaller in scale, utilizing existing libraries to build a finite numberof interactive elements within a controlled environment. This contrastswith the vast complexity of full-scale game development, where thedifficulty arises from the myriad interactions between diverse objectsystems - like physics, collision, and interaction logic.</p><p>[ 28:55 ] Take collision logic as an instance; the multitude ofpossible outcomes from a single collision event can be incrediblyintricate to code. If we consider bullet dynamics in games, the behaviorof these projectiles upon impact with walls, enemies, or objects variesdramatically, leading to a cascade of different effects. Coding theseinteractions is a lot of work. It would be enlightening to study howgame developers handle this complexity and whether there are ways tosimplify the process. The Entity Component System (ECS) attempts tomitigate this by adopting an actor-like model, but even then, complexityescalates rapidly as interactions increase.</p><p>[ 30:56 ] Despite efforts to manage these interactions, there comes apoint where local decisions require some form of higher-levelorchestration. When a bullet is fired, for instance, numerous actionsmust be coordinated, from ammo count adjustments to triggeringanimations. All this complexity makes game programming something I wouldnot want to revisit except in the context of my research. However, therelies a vast potential for impactful research in understanding and easingthe complexities of game development. Game studios, being the behemothsthey are, would undoubtedly embrace methods to alleviate the strenuousnature of their programming efforts. Yes, indeed.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [32:00] Indeed, that aligns with my central interests. Mymaster's thesis on Python type inference encountered similar challengesto those you've highlighted. In analyzing types, one must grapple withsubstantial propagation throughout the program. This is precisely theissue at hand, and it serves as a prime motivator in my quest to developformalizations that simplify the process for programmers, particularlyin areas like game development, where complex interactions arecommonplace.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [32:45] You've sparked a thought here - this may be adigression - but I'm curious. Has there been research into the amount oftyping necessary for untyped code to converge? You made an excellentpoint about the recursive search required in untyped code to determinetypes, which resembles an intricate graph search. However, it's morethan that because the connections in the 'type graph' are not alwaysapparent. This raises an intriguing theoretical question: At what pointin a code base's typing does the cost shift from an exponential to alinear time complexity? It's a highly theoretical question, indeed, andone that surely must have been examined in terms of computationalcomplexity.</p><p>[34:58] It's fascinating because most research focuses on strongtyping systems and type inference within defined parameters. But thedynamics change with untyped constructs. Apologies for the tangent -it's just a curious question.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [35:32] Your point is very interesting, and it ispertinent to my future research endeavors.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [35:39] There ought to be studies on this - howcomputationally complex is a type system? The PL community has likelydelved into this. However, the issue becomes significantly morecompelling when considering untyped languages. Sorry for the tangent,but it's a topic worth exploring.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [36:15] Returning to our discussion, my work in typeinference for Python resonates with your mention of interaction-heavydomains like game programming.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [36:27] Certainly. Game programming exemplifies ascenario with extensive object interactions, which is atypical in mostsystems where such interactions are minimized. For instance, hiring astudent triggers a cascade of bureaucratic actions, illustrating how asingle decision can activate multiple layers of complexity. Managingthese interactions presents a formidable challenge in softwareengineering - taming the complexity is a substantial part of the job.However, game programming provides a more structured context to studythese complexities, with ample open-source resources for research.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [38:55] Your insights on game programming are quitevaluable.</p><p>[38:59] I hadn't realized the prominence of such problems in thatfield. Your points offer an excellent foundation for my research intothese issues.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [39:16] There are indeed intriguing researchopportunities at the intersection of AI, software, programminglanguages, and HCI. Although my HCI pursuits are broad, one key HCIinterest is explainable AI. As language models advance, the ability toexplain AI operations lags, posing a risk of increasing reliance oninscrutable systems. Advancing explainable AI methodologies will becritical in HCI, particularly in the coming years.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [42:10] Yes, indeed. What captivates my interest more thanthe empirical approach to software engineering - like automated bugdetection and performance optimization - is the human-computerinteraction aspect, particularly making developers' lives easier. Thisis crucial, especially for rapid prototyping.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [42:42] Right, your IDE example aligns perfectly withthat. It's a tool that enhances usability for people - expanding howthey interact with typing. It could very well be something forpublication. So, you're drawing connections here. When do you expect tograduate?</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [43:05] If all goes according to my advisor's plan, Ishould graduate in May 2024.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [43:13] Okay. And your advisor is?</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [43:16] Caroline Lemieux from the Software PracticesLab.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [43:20] Oh, yes, she's a recent addition. So, she'sguiding you toward a May graduation. And regarding your Ph.D., are youconsidering continuing in the Software Practices Lab or exploring otherareas?</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [43:38] Well, our lab's focus is split between userstudies and the technical side, like bug detection or software fuzzing,and, on the other hand, theoretical topics like formal semantics. Thereisn't much overlap with HCI and usability, so I'm uncertain about whereI'll pursue a Ph.D., if at all, but likely not within our SoftwarePractices Lab.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [44:21] That's something to ponder, especially as youapproach graduation in May. Are you already applying to Ph.D.programs?</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [44:34] I am still deciding. I'm still considering myoptions.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [44:38] Sure, it's a big decision. My focus is onVR/AR-related projects, where my funding comes from. It's trickier toshift to developing support tools for developers without an establishedportfolio. However, I'm open to discussing co-advisory opportunities orcommittee collaborations if you pursue a Ph.D. here at UBC.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [45:44] That's encouraging to hear.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [45:45] To clarify, I'm not sure I could supervise aPh.D., but I'm open to discussing future possibilities.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [45:59] That aligns with my thoughts as well.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [46:01] Engaging in research discussions can help refineyour interests, which is beneficial for crafting a strong researchstatement for Ph.D. applications. These conversations can guide yourinitial research direction, even though your focus may evolve.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [47:10] Thank you for the insights and advice today.They've been very helpful, and I'll reflect on them further.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [47:24] I'm glad to assist. You should have my emailaddress.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [47:30] Is it listed on your website?</p><p>Robert Xiao: [47:32] It should be - unless my website isn't updatedwith my current email, which would be a blunder. Let me check.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [47:36] I'll look it up.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [47:37] If it's on there, then it's correct.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [47:45] Yes, it's on your site.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [47:47] Great, feel free to reach out anytime.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [47:56] I'm impressed by your work and would be happy toattend your thesis presentation when the time comes.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [48:15] I appreciate that. Our conversation today has beenvery enjoyable.</p><p>Robert Xiao: [48:21] It was an enlightening chat, indeed. If you havefurther questions or topics, don't hesitate to email me.</p><p>Jifeng Wu: [48:34] For now, that's all I have. If something elsecomes up, I'll send you an email.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1id="introduction-to-prof.-margo-seltzer-quoted-from-wikipedia">Introductionto Prof. Margo Seltzer (quoted from Wikipedia)</h1><p>"<strong>Margo Ilene Seltzer</strong> is a professor and researcherin computer systems. She is currently the Canada 150 Research Chair inComputer Systems and the Cheriton Family Chair in Computer Science atthe <ahref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia"title="University of British Columbia">University of BritishColumbia</a>. Previously, Seltzer was the Herchel Smith Professor ofComputer Science at Harvard University's <ahref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Paulson_School_of_Engineering_and_Applied_Sciences"title="John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences">JohnA. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a> and directorat the <ahref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Research_on_Computation_and_Society"title="Center for Research on Computation and Society">Center forResearch on Computation and Society</a>."</p><h1id="question-how-did-you-conduct-research-across-a-variety-of-domains-from-operating-systems-to-machine-learning-systems">Question:How did you conduct research across a variety of domains, from operatingsystems to machine learning systems?</h1><p>Prof. Seltzer: I've always been intellectually curious and I findalmost all research problems fascinating. Engaging in discussions withdiverse people has also fueled my passion. When I was a junior facultymember, I focused on tenure and focused on core systems research, butthat was miserable. However, I still explored different areas.</p><p>My deep interest lies in software architecture, even though my Ph.D.was in storage. I was fortunate when another lab decided to support myresearch. This shift allowed me to progress from storage to coresystems.</p><p>I also got interested into data provenance, especially realizing thatwe could do a lot more at the systems level.</p><p>Transitioning to machine learning was a natural progression, drivenmainly by collaborations with graduate students and other partners.</p><h1id="question-why-did-you-pursue-a-ph.d.-in-storage-if-you-were-more-interested-in-core-systems">Question:Why did you pursue a Ph.D. in storage if you were more interested incore systems?</h1><p>Prof. Seltzer: Before pursuing my Ph.D., I was primarily involvedwith databases. However, as I delved deeper, my curiosity veered towardssystem issues.</p><h1id="question-how-do-you-manage-evolving-interests-during-a-ph.d.">Question:How do you manage evolving interests during a Ph.D.?</h1><p>Prof. Seltzer: It's uncommon for Ph.D. students to plot a lifetimeresearch agenda. Instead, it's about producing one miracle per paper anddeveloping the skills to do research for your whole life. The key is tofocus on accomplishing your first piece of independent research duringyour Ph.D.</p><p>Choosing a supervisor you get along well with is most important. It'sessential to be involved in an interesting area and join a lab thataligns with your interests. However, a perfect match isn't alwaysnecessary. Looking at co-supervised students can give insights intopotential co-supervision opportunities.</p><p>As a Ph.D. student, your primary goal should be to define yourresearch problem. Although you shouldn't jump between entirely differentareas, it's crucial to select a project that genuinely interests you inthe first year. Other interests can be pursued as side projects.</p><p>To maintain engagement, pick a broad domain that offers a plethora ofprojects you find captivating.</p><p>Before starting a Ph.D., actively seek out research papers thatintrigue you and identify the labs behind them.</p><h1id="question-whats-your-vision-for-the-future-of-computer-systems">Question:What's your vision for the future of Computer Systems?</h1><p>Prof. Seltzer: A pressing concern is that people are not very good atwriting software that works. We need to develop strategies to createsoftware with minimal bugs from the ground up. Embracing modularity canbe a solution, and the solution is about software architecture.</p><p>Researchers focus on verifying existing software products because thepublication cycle is way too short. Moreover, we lack good metrics forevaluating software architecture, and there is no equivalent of adebugger for software architecture. Software architecture, in itscurrent state, remains an art more than a well-defined discipline.Often, professionals in the field rely heavily on mentors, and theydon't see the growth of a new generation of software architects.</p><h1 id="personal-comments-and-recommendations">Personal Comments andRecommendations:</h1><p>I'm pleased to note your inspiration derived from challenges in the'Type Inference for Python' project, including the importance offormalizations and specifications both for the design goal and forimplementation, the tedious and fault-prone task of setting up anevaluation pipeline, etc.</p><p>Deep learning thrives in domains with a clear ground truth. In otherscenarios, basic probabilistic methods might offer better results.</p><p>Your task of combining AST traversal with introspection of liveobjects reminds me of the work I did in "StarFlow: A Script-Centric DataAnalysis Environment" and Arpan Gujarati's tracing infrastructureefforts in Python.</p><p>Should you wish to delve deeper into software architecture for datascience and machine learning, I recommend focusing on constructingintricate software like operating systems instead of shorter datawrangling scripts. Or you can explore the challenges in experimentalframeworks. For insights on this, consider discussing with Joe Wonsil.Additionally, Philip Guo at UCSD has an intriguing Ph.D. thesis abouttools for research programmers that might be of interest to you.</p>]]></content>
